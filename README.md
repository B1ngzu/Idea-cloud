This project is part of the course **“Introduction to Computer Engineering and Digital Technology (2110222), Semester 1/2025”**, Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University.


## 💡 Project Background

Innovation often starts with a single idea, but turning abstract interests into concrete projects is a common challenge. Our team identified three key obstacles facing creators today:

1.  **Vague Concepts:** Many individuals have interests in specific fields (e.g., Technology, Health, Environment) but struggle to translate them into actionable project specifications.
2.  **Fragmented Resources:** Inspiration and information are often scattered across various sources, making the research process time-consuming and inefficient.
3.  **Lack of Specialized Platforms:** Existing social media channels are too broad and not designed for deep, specific idea exchange, hindering meaningful innovation and collaboration.

**Idea Cloud** was developed to bridge these gaps. By integrating **AI technology**, the platform assists users in generating and refining ideas systematically. Furthermore, it creates a centralized community for sharing and collaborating, fostering an ecosystem where new innovations can thrive.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend:** Express, Mongoose
- **AI:** Google Gemini API



## 🤖 LLM API Integration

Idea Cloud leverages Large Language Model (LLM) APIs to enhance the ideation process through three key features:

1. **Automated Idea Generation** Users can input a topic or keyword, and the system utilizes the LLM API to generate relevant, structured ideas, providing a quick starting point for project development.

2. **Smart Categorization** Once ideas are generated, the AI automatically analyzes and classifies them into specific categories, making it easier for users to browse and filter ideas efficiently.

3. **Idea Expansion** Users can select an idea of interest to request further elaboration. The API generates detailed extensions and related concepts to help refine the idea into a concrete project plan.
